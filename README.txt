Directions for running final project python script and R markdown report

Step 1:  run the python script "DSP539_DT.py". This file is written in python 3.  The script reads in the data set from the Data directory and conducts analyses needed for the R markdown report.  This can be accomplished by copying/pasting the following line to your teminal command line:

python DSP539_DT.py

Step 2:  open and knit the "Fellers_Project_RMD.Rmd" file. This will produce the final report. The report pulls from the Data and Results folder, as it conducts some analyses through R code and references outputs from the Step 1 python code.
